## SQL-PROJECT 1
data analyst SQL portfolio project - Pizza Hut sales

ðŸŒŸ **Data-Driven Insights with MySQL** ðŸŒŸ  

I have worked on this pizza sales dataset using MySQL Workbench, tackling challenges across basic, intermediate, and advanced-level queries. Here are some of the highlights:  
- **Basic Queries**:  
  - Retrieved total orders and revenue.  
  - Identified the most popular pizza sizes and the highest-priced pizza.  
  - Highlighted the top 5 most-ordered pizza types.  

- **Intermediate Analysis**:  
  - Explored category-wise pizza distributions and hourly ordering patterns.  
  - Calculated the average daily pizza orders and identified top sellers by revenue.  

- **Advanced Insights**:  
  - Analyzed revenue contributions by pizza type.  
  - Visualized cumulative revenue growth.  
  - Identified top-performing pizzas by revenue within each category.  

This project honed my skills in data querying, joining, grouping, and performing insightful analyses to uncover trends and actionable insights.  

ðŸ’» Tools: MySQL Workbench  
ðŸ“ˆ Techniques: Joins, Grouping, Aggregation, Revenue Analysis  

I am always excited to apply these skills to real-world datasets and drive data-driven decision-making.
